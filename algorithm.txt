Assignment 2 Algorithm

First, need to determine the movement of racer A:
  1. Choose a random integer 0-9
  2. Using an array of the possible movements, find the result at the position of that random integer
  3. Add to the position of racer A the new move
  4. Check if the new space is before the starting line, in which case their position will be replaced by the starting line

Then, repeat the process for racer B. In addition, check if the new 2 positions are equal. If so, racer A's position loses one.

To print, it will determine which racer is behind. The position of that racer - 1 is the number of spaces it will print first. Then it prints the letter of the first racer. Then, it will calculate the difference between racer A and B, and print that number of spaces. Then it will print the next racer's letter. Then, it will do 50 - initial spaces - difference spaces - 2 and print that number of spaces
