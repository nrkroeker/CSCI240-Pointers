Assignment 2 Algorithm

First, I need to determine the movement of racer A:
  1. Choose a random integer 0-9
  2. Make the percentage likelihoods into a set of domains.
  3. Check which domain it falls in, this will be the movement that the racer does.
  4. Add that movement number to the racer's position.
  5. If the position moves it back before the start line, it needs to be back on the start line. OR if the movement takes it past the finish line, it needs to be right on the finish line.

Then, repeat the process for racer B. In addition, check if the new 2 positions are equal. If so, racer A's position loses one.

To print, it will determine which racer is behind. The position of that racer - 1 is the number of spaces it will print first. Then it prints the letter of the first racer. Then, it will calculate the difference between racer A and B, and print that number of spaces. Then it will print the next racer's letter. Then, it will do RACE_LENGTH - the second racer's position, and print that number of spaces
